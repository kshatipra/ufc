# We don't need OOP!

## Challenges / Coding culture

### Declarative vs imperative paradigm

- imperative paradigm is characterised by verbs
- declarative paradigm is characterised by properties

### Make it fast

- as an excuse for no design

### `Ã¬f` is a smell 

- factories is where conditionals go to die
- null objects

### FOOP

- "False OOP"
- "Pretend OOP"

### Saw-tooth patterns / tachicardia / squint test

- nested if-elses, match-case statements

### An object trying to get out

### `Toulouse` approach

- everything can be solved with two (or more) nested loops

### `Blank line` code smell

### How to identify an object?

- is it "a noun and a verb"?
  - this may lead to forced properties and behaviours
- `is-a`, `has-a`, `behaves-like` relationships
- what changes?
- extract similarities

### When to refactor?

- Design pay-off (Martin Fowler)

### Everything is a factory

### When to use inheritance and when to use composition

- Sub-class explosion
- random echo house (two-axis problem)

## What did I learn

### Creating a tool-box

## Application in the real world

## Organisation

### You have to implement to benefit

- education is frustration coupled with inspiration

### Off-line only -- participation is essential

- if you listen in, you do not learn

### Presenting by the author -- discussion without author's participation VVV

- once the code is presented, it is in the public forum and is 'neutral'
- many novel ways to solve one problem
- ideas 

### Finding patterns through experience

- solutions are not introduced

## Refactoring walk-through ^^^

- tennis score?
- random echo house?
